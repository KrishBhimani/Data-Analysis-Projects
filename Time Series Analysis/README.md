Issues with Dynamic Plots

Due to limitations in GitHub's rendering capabilities, the dynamic plots generated from the code may not be displayed directly. As a result, I have provided a separate document (Time Series Analysis Plots.docx) that includes all the plots generated from the code. You can download and view the document to explore the plots in detail.
